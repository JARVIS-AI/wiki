## UART
UART is accessible on the Pi-2 bus (same pins as on a Raspberry Pi), using a baud rate of 1500000.

## MAC Address
The MAC address for the system is configurable in /boot/boot.txt.  Use spaces instead of colons between each octet.  After making changes, run the *mkscr* script from within /boot.
